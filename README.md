Style Sheets

Matplotlib has style sheets you can use to make our plots look a little nicer. These style sheets include plot_bmh,plot_fivethirtyeight,plot_ggplot and more. They basically create a set of style rules that your plots follow. They make all our plots have the same look and feel more professional. We can even create our own if we want our company's plots to all have the same look (it is a bit tedious to create on though).
